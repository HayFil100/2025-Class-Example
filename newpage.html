    <p>Outer space is an enormous, mysterious expanse that begins just beyond Earth’s atmosphere and stretches farther than we can fully comprehend.

Stars are born, galaxies collide, and planets orbit their suns in an intricate cosmic dance. The scale of space is so massive that distances are measured in light-years, the distance light travels in a year—about 5.88 trillion miles.

One of the most fascinating<span> <div class = "red"> SILLY BILLY BOBBY </span> aspects of space is how little we truly understand about it. Scientists estimate that most of the universe is made up of dark matter and dark energy, mysterious substances that we can’t see directly but know must exist because of their effects on gravity and expansion. Telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope help us peer deeper into the universe than ever before, giving us images of ancient galaxies formed just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. Every discovery raises new questions, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.

Space also inspires exploration and imagination. Humans have walked on the moon, lived on the International Space Station, and sent rovers to Mars to search for signs of past life. Space travel has helped us better understand our own planet, such as climate patterns and natural disasters. As technology improves, many people dream of traveling deeper into space—perhaps even visiting Mars or beyond. Whether for science, adventure, or curiosity, the exploration of space continues to bring people together in a shared quest to understand the universe.</p>
